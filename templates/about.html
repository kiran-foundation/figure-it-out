    <p> Your body type is incredibly important, especially when it comes to fashion. An outfit that looks great on a
        lean model will definitely look different on someone with a pear-shaped body.
        But before you can learn how to dress for your body shape, you first need to know what your body type actually is.
        Read on for more information about body types, a body shape calculator, and even a body type test. </p>

    <h4>  So, What Is My Body Type? How To Measure Your Body
        While most people can tell what their body type is just by looking in the mirror, you can get a more accurate reading
          by actually measuring your body. Hereâ€™s how: </h4>

    <p>Using a measuring tape, get the measurement of your bust. Wear a proper-fitting bra and measure around the fullest
        part of your chest. Ask a friend to help you with this one. Get the measurement of your shoulders. The tape should
        wrap around you at the highest point without it slipping off. Then, get the measurement of your waist.
        This is the area right above your belly button and is usually the narrowest part of your torso (although not always).
        Finally, get your hips measurement. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart. Find the widest point of your hip area,
        which should be low enough that the tape passes around the top of your butt as well. </p>
    <h4> The Different Female Body Types </h4>
     <h6>   Hourglass </h6>
    <p>Women with an hourglass body have their bust and hips at roughly the same measurement,
        while also having a narrower, defined waist. This is one of the curvy female body shapes. </p>

    <h6> Triangle/Spoon </h6>
    <p> The pear-shaped body type is bottom-heavy, which means that your bust and shoulders are narrower than your hips and
        butt. While     pear and spoon have similar silhouettes, spoon-shaped bodies have a more rectangular upper body with
        a heavier midsection. </p>
